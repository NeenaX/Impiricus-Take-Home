As such, it features readings from political science, economics, and sociology. While there is no specific regional focus of this class, the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia are heavily featured. We seek to answer multiple questions, such as: what are the causal initiators and obstacles to development? How does this vary across regional, national, and sub-national experiences? What are the distinct features and challenges of developing countries’ political and economic systems? How do global and domestic forces operate independently and interactively.

Historically, one reason Americans have been thought to tolerate inequality is that we tend to believe that our society is a mobile one, where people can easily move from one social class to another. But in recent years, inequality and stagnant social mobility have been associated with increasing social and political distrust and unrest. In this junior seminar, we will examine the economic and political, and ideological factors that have contributed to this historical moment, learn about how Americans experience living in an unequal society, and consider the future of equality and social mobility in the United States.

Through an on-the-ground and ethnographic engagement with displaced communities worldwide, we interrogate analytical distinctions between legal and illegal categories of asylum seekers and migrants, internally displaced and refugees. Rather than treating refugeehood as an immanent crisis, we examine how the language of crisis shapes migration in the era of global capitalism.

BIOL 2350, The Biology of Aging,"Aging is a fundamental biological process. It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of ""geroscience"" – the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases. Course material will be based on the primary research literature.

AFRI 1085, The Black Vote: A Critical Interrogation of a Concept,"“The black vote” as a concept, simultaneously captures a truth and obscures reality. It reflects the truth that no other racial group comes close to the uniformity of Black Americans’ voting behavior within American electoral politics. Yet, it also obscures the diversity of political opinions and ideological dispositions that animate a dynamic black American public. If voting is an essential means to give citizens voice and their share in self-rule within a democracy, this course explores what it means for the stability of American democracy that the black vote does not reflect the political diversity of the black community.",Bulletin

AFRI 1097," AI, Health Data, and Race","AI and health data are reshaping the future of medicine, public health, and human well-being. However, the ways AI engages with race and health data raise critical questions: Who is included in health data? How do AI-driven models transform medical knowledge? What innovative possibilities exist for AI in healthcare beyond narratives of bias and harm? Drawing on an Africana Studies perspective, this course offers an expansive exploration of these questions, balancing critical perspectives with an exploration of AI’s potential to advance health, improve diagnostics, and create new knowledge systems.

AFRI 1098, Black Digital Humanities: Black Technocultures,"What difference does Blackness make to the study of technology? This course relies on this question to foreground two important elements within the Black Digital Humanities (Black DH). First, Black scholarly approaches to the impact of technology on and in Black life and vice versa. Second, Black scholarly explorations of Black digital life and expertise. We will take a broad approach to Black DH, thinking generally about the transformative interplay between Blackness and digital technology, the extent to which digital projects can “recover” Black histories within the archive, and methodological approaches to the study of tech and digital life within Black Studies. Drawing on Black epistemologies, students will analyze digital technologies to propose new and different questions about how Blackness both (re)shapes technology and the “human” in the humanities.",Bulletin
AFRI 1099, Alternative Technofutures: Black Speculative Visioning for a Better Tomorrow,"In the last decade, we have witnessed the acceleration of technological experimentation and production. As such, this class explores the role that Black speculation plays in helping us envision and create technocultures beyond empire. Together, we will explore imperialism and colonialism as they manifest in our digital age, paying particular attention to how digital technologies like predictive algorithms, machine learning, surveillance, and data extraction extend and innovate on these systems of power. After initial grounding in the study of technology, speculative art and literature, and speculative design, we will pivot to “labs” where you will be able to read and analyze Black speculative works, develop a Black speculative method based on these works, and apply that method to your design of a technological tool that addresses a social problem.",Bulletin

This course focuses upon this history to examine the centrality of slavery and empire in the making of the United States. Crucial to the formation of racial capitalism, U.S. slavery’s growth was driven forward by unprecedented economic transformation and territorial conquest. This slavery-based expansion was defined by settler warfare that remade the United States into a vast, continental empire.

What is systemic racism? What role does it play in society and how have African Americans responded to it? This course will use the lens of “systemic racism” to explore the interconnections between policies and practices that create a network of devastating forms of racial discrimination and disadvantage; conditions that have shifted over time and have made it difficult for black communities, and individuals within them, to flourish.

AFRI 1215," The Visual Culture of 1930s: Race, Gender, and the Laboring Body","The 1930s mark a moment of extraordinary change in the United States. The Great Depression precipitated a rethinking and reordering of the federal government’s response to economic, political, and social institutions. As part of this rethinking, the federal government sponsored an unprecedented number of art projects, creating jobs for thousands of painters, sculptors, photographers, printmakers, architects, filmmakers, writers, and actors.

But is there more to this battle than abortion? Beginning with Roe v. Wade, this course explores how welfare, labor, citizenship, the family, religion, and activism alter mainstream conceptions of reproductive politics. Using a variety of sources, including films and websites, we will consider what an expansive reproductive freedom might entail. Enrollment limited to 17 first year students and sophomores.",Bulletin

What is the relationship between social science and social order? How has what is understood as “normal” served as description, prescription, and a locus of power? What role have the social sciences played in defining the ideal life in America? This course uses approaches from the disciplines of history, science and technology studies, and gender and sexuality studies to critically examine and interrogate the construction and maintenance of intersecting hierarchies of gender, class, and race, paying particular attention to their basis in material socioeconomic relations, reification in state authority, and their reflection in various forms of cultural production.",Bulletin

We will be interested in texts that demonstrate how writing about art reveals relations and politics. How does art orient itself toward various audiences, establishing intimacy, community, or antagonism, and how can art writing expose these triangulated relationships between the artist, art object, and audience? How do we live with art and how does it determine not only the content of our writing but our lives? Our readings will include a variety of ekphrastic texts, including poetry, memoirs, personal and lyric essays, academic essays, and theory, in addition to screening films and viewing visual art, performance, and digital media.

When Black and brown bodies have historically been sites of colonial and gendered violence, what does it mean to center the body as a site of knowledge production? This course draws upon the emergent performance and aesthetic practices as disruptions of colonial violence; and their relationship to racialized, gendered, and sexual power dynamics. This course will deeply consider what it means to be (in)human, erotic reconfigurations of being, and fugitive practice. We will draw from frameworks in performance studies, Black feminism, women of color feminism, and queer theory to understand the body as a living archive of memory, violence, and liberation. Such attention to performance and aesthetic practices entail not only histories of conquest and genocide, but the creative and life-bearing practices that transcend these conditions of captivity and loss.",Bulletin

Trans*formative Ecologies understands trans and environmental study as co-articulable collaborators speaking to and working with each other as endeavors that unstick the fixities that organize our sociopolitical landscape, interrogate systems of power, and daringly imagine otherwise with an openness to change amid a climate of multiple urgencies. This seminar introduces students to conversations in trans studies and decolonial environmental humanities through key texts in both fields, with consideration to subaltern theories and methodologies, cultural geography, literary studies, creative practice, and visual & aesthetic culture. These approaches contribute to and diverge from canonical feminist and queer theory, and renegotiate the anthropocentric, Western framework that often dominates dialogue pertaining to environmental study. Brought together, these fields collectively scrutinize dominant modes of thinking, conventional approaches, and methods of inquiry.SprAMST0192TS0126667TTh6:40-8:00PM(18)(I. Essex)",Bulletin

The 21st century has seen a proliferation of LGBTQ+ representation in media through an apparently progressive political moment – from the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell to federal legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States. However, these new media have also come up among increased censorship, book bans, and homo- and transphobic violence, in a reflection of the not-so-linear story of queer representation. By examining memoir, film, television, and internet cultures, we will explore these developments through a framework of queer that goes beyond sexual orientation, and consider the role of the non-normative under racial capitalism, heteropatriarchy, the carceral state, and United States empire across oceans.SprAMST0192US0126595TTh9:00-10:20(05)(K.

Focusing on close readings of popular film, novels, and scientific papers related to time travel, ""Fictions of Science"" considers why, despite this extraordinary relationship, we often rely on the most simplistic gizmo - that aforementioned time machine - to serve as an explanatory shortcut. And why we miss the exciting truth: that science and fiction are joined together in incredibly complicated ways, with consequences for design, imagination, and exploration.

Characterized by scholars as neo-slave narratives and, later, post-neo slave narratives, contemporary fictions of US slavery deploy the formal features and thematic concerns of the slave narrative to reveal Black freedom dreams of later periods. Examining recent literary, filmic, and televisual representations of US slavery, this course foregrounds racial slavery in the establishment of longstanding socioeconomic and political asymmetries across race, gender, and class in the US. And it analyzes the ways in which imaginative depictions of racial slavery seek to address and ameliorate such asymmetries. Our class will pay particular attention to how contemporary Black writers and filmmakers thematize labor, love, gender, power, pleasure, community, and resistance among the enslaved and their descendants.SprAMST1920AS0127844T1:00-3:30(A.

This course will focus on two interrelated themes. The first is the implementation of immigration and nationality controls designed to manage cross-border traffic and restrict membership in the national community. The second is to explore how the projection of US power beyond its territorial borders (e.g. US empire) has fueled cross-border movement between metropole and colonial/postcolonial zones. We will highlight the ways in which the US’s encroachment of borders outside its territorial domain raises important questions about the meaning and legitimacy of national sovereignty and the fashioning of immigrant “illegality.”",Bulletin

We will ask: How are aesthetics a critical site of both colonization and decolonial refusal? How can we collectively explore the relational capacities and overtones imbued within Indigenous and minoritarian aesthetics? How do activists, artists, writers, etc. employ aesthetics as the conduit to building anticolonial solidarities across diverse contexts?

Taking our cue from Driftpile Cree poet Billy-Ray Belcourt, we will question the ways in which the “grammar of Indigenous Studies misapprehends the tumult of everyday life” through the field’s emphasis on sovereignty and political recognition. We will trace a colonial history that has made categories such as “the human” and “the subject” unavailable to Native people, and consider the affective conditions created for individuals living within a state made possible only through their elimination.

Inspired by the groundbreaking work of Indigenous scholars, artists, and activists, we will explore the healing power of gender and sexual diversity. All throughout the course, we will also learn about the fight of Indigenous peoples to reclaim sovereignty over their own bodies. In this sense, we will approach Indigenous gender and sexuality as active tools for decolonization. While the course’s primary geographic focus is Anglo-North America—with a specific emphasis in the United States—it aims to be hemispheric (and global) in its approach.",Bulletin

ANTH 1253, The Visual and the Written in Anthropology: Fruzzetti's Documentary Films and Ethnographic Research,"A seminar that analyses the making of films in the light of ethnographic research in rural India. The course addresses fifty years of research covering the journey of an anthropologist’s work in a rural Bengali town, documenting the voices and narratives of women. The research is immersed in traditional anthropological fieldwork, followed by the publication of books and articles that complement Fruzzetti's films. Documentary films and texts will demonstrate a continuity between visual and written works. Do films inform or deviate from our understanding of written ethnography (and vice versa)? What distinguishes early documentary films from later ethnographic ones? Do films record ""reality"" or interpret just as written works do? Should ethnographic study come before the making of documentary films? Can anthropological theory develop in relation to or separate from ethnographic films?",Bulletin

ANTH 2271, Fiction / Ethnography (+ the space between),"What is the relationship between fiction and ethnography, story and fact, creativity and objectivity? This course will consider how fiction and ethnography can each inform yet trouble the other, beginning from the premise that both involve a kind of magic. Using the same building blocks – seemingly humble and ostensibly available to all --writers of fiction and ethnography alike create what one contemporary author has called “language-made hallucinations, fabrications that persuade us to believe in them.” Yet these “fabrications” often have different stakes and use different methods for revealing human “truths.” We’ll explore such divergences and alignments by seeing what is provoked when juxtaposing fiction, ethnography, and even other genres of writing (poetry, journalism, creative non-fiction, etc.). Writing assignments for the course, as befits the content, are flexible with respect to genre.",Bulletin

Rather than seeing the State as a fixed, absolute entity that exists on a separate plane of existence, this course analyzes the state as an effect-producing abstraction that arises in contested circulations of meaningful signs. Viewing the state as a material abstraction (a complex sign) rather than as an absolute entity, we turn to theories of differentiation in circulation and movement. We attempt to answer the questions: What is movement? What moves? And what does movement create, break down, and change? Thinking about the implications of such questions, we will consider the extent to which differentiations in movement carve out units of governance, how the differences produced in those units might generate change, and how forms of difference might partially escape and alter such movement (or not).FallANTH2325S0117599Th4:00-6:30(04)(M.
