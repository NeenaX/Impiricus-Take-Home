AFRI 0410,After the Uprisings: Abolition and Black Studies,Justin Langjustin_a_lang@brown.edu,T 4pm-6:30pm in Churchill House 206,,AFRI,"This small, discussion-based seminar will examine the concept of “abolition” and its relationship to Black Studies. In the aftermath of the uprisings of 2020, abolition has become part of popular discourse in ways hardly imagined by some of its theorists and practitioners. The framework is most often aimed at carceral structures such as police, prisons, and surveillance, yet some interpretations of abolition take aim at the state, borders, and even the world. This seminar will explore the varied discourses of abolition and invite students to wrestle with the theoretical and practical difficulties the framework is confronted with, such as questions of law, politics, gender, and temporality. A key site of inquiry will be the methods of struggle proposed to get from the present to the anticipated abolitionist future.

AFRI 0101, White Supremacy,,,,AFRI,"This class focuses on the long history and present circumstance of white supremacy, on its unchanging character and regular reinvention. Drawing together decades of scholarly work, the class envisions white supremacy as a structure, an ideology, a culture, and a psychology - and as the keystone of historical experiences we now often see as distinct: genocide, apartheid, nativism, segregation, settler colonialism, racialized policing, and personal prejudice.

Because of this, the histories we tell are often explanatory. They delineate how we arrived at this moment and tell us which people and what events were most consequential. But what happens when the people who look like you are not part of the story? Or if their inclusion amounts to cameos in support of a larger narrative that ultimately minimizes or ignores their contributions?

We critically analyze the notion of ""Mistaking Africa"" focusing on deconstructing stereotypes, challenging misconceptions, and promoting a more nuanced understanding of Sub-Saharan Africa's diverse cultures, histories, and contemporary realities. Students will read literature, analyze popular culture, and examine primary sources to study European imperialism and racism; colonial systems of forced labor and wage labor; African resistance and collaboration; the Christianizing and westernizing effects of colonial education; the transformation of gender, class, and ethnic identities, and African nations’ struggle for political autonomy.",Bulletin

Global health also tends to promote a perspective that it is about those people over there and has nothing to do with us here. This course will create a platform that ties the global to the local. We will discuss how political and cultural discourse on race, class, and gender create the conditions that allow social inequalities to thrive.",Bulletin

AFRI 1085, The Black Vote: A Critical Interrogation of a Concept,,,,AFRI,"“The black vote” as a concept, simultaneously captures a truth and obscures reality. It reflects the truth that no other racial group comes close to the uniformity of Black Americans’ voting behavior within American electoral politics. Yet, it also obscures the diversity of political opinions and ideological dispositions that animate a dynamic black American public.

We will take a broad approach to Black DH, thinking generally about the transformative interplay between Blackness and digital technology, the extent to which digital projects can “recover” Black histories within the archive, and methodological approaches to the study of tech and digital life within Black Studies. Drawing on Black epistemologies, students will analyze digital technologies to propose new and different questions about how Blackness both (re)shapes technology and the “human” in the humanities.",Bulletin

This seminar introduces students to conversations in trans studies and decolonial environmental humanities through key texts in both fields, with consideration to subaltern theories and methodologies, cultural geography, literary studies, creative practice, and visual & aesthetic culture. These approaches contribute to and diverge from canonical feminist and queer theory, and renegotiate the anthropocentric, Western framework that often dominates dialogue pertaining to environmental study. Brought together, these fields collectively scrutinize dominant modes of thinking, conventional approaches, and methods of inquiry.SprAMST0192TS0126667TTh6:40-8:00PM(18)(I. Essex)",Bulletin
AMST 0192U, What’s Queer about Queer Media Now?,,,,AMST,"What makes media queer? Who does it represent? What does it do? The 21st century has seen a proliferation of LGBTQ+ representation in media through an apparently progressive political moment – from the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell to federal legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States. However, these new media have also come up among increased censorship, book bans, and homo- and transphobic violence, in a reflection of the not-so-linear story of queer representation. By examining memoir, film, television, and internet cultures, we will explore these developments through a framework of queer that goes beyond sexual orientation, and consider the role of the non-normative under racial capitalism, heteropatriarchy, the carceral state, and United States empire across oceans.SprAMST0192US0126595TTh9:00-10:20(05)(K.

We will critically analyze the theoretical frames through which psychedelic drugs have been imagined and discussed in science, politics, media, and popular culture. We will think through questions of freedom, bodily autonomy, consciousness, hedonism, political radicalism, capitalism, and labor.

Characterized by scholars as neo-slave narratives and, later, post-neo slave narratives, contemporary fictions of US slavery deploy the formal features and thematic concerns of the slave narrative to reveal Black freedom dreams of later periods. Examining recent literary, filmic, and televisual representations of US slavery, this course foregrounds racial slavery in the establishment of longstanding socioeconomic and political asymmetries across race, gender, and class in the US. And it analyzes the ways in which imaginative depictions of racial slavery seek to address and ameliorate such asymmetries. Our class will pay particular attention to how contemporary Black writers and filmmakers thematize labor, love, gender, power, pleasure, community, and resistance among the enslaved and their descendants.SprAMST1920AS0127844T1:00-3:30(A.

This course will focus on two interrelated themes. The first is the implementation of immigration and nationality controls designed to manage cross-border traffic and restrict membership in the national community. The second is to explore how the projection of US power beyond its territorial borders (e.g. US empire) has fueled cross-border movement between metropole and colonial/postcolonial zones.

Rather than seeing the State as a fixed, absolute entity that exists on a separate plane of existence, this course analyzes the state as an effect-producing abstraction that arises in contested circulations of meaningful signs. Viewing the state as a material abstraction (a complex sign) rather than as an absolute entity, we turn to theories of differentiation in circulation and movement. We attempt to answer the questions: What is movement? What moves? And what does movement create, break down, and change? Thinking about the implications of such questions, we will consider the extent to which differentiations in movement carve out units of governance, how the differences produced in those units might generate change, and how forms of difference might partially escape and alter such movement (or not).",CAB

Viewing the state as a material abstraction (a complex sign) rather than as an absolute entity, we turn to theories of differentiation in circulation and movement. We attempt to answer the questions: What is movement? What moves? And what does movement create, break down, and change? Thinking about the implications of such questions, we will consider the extent to which differentiations in movement carve out units of governance, how the differences produced in those units might generate change, and how forms of difference might partially escape and alter such movement (or not).FallANTH2325S0117599Th4:00-6:30(04)(M.

ARTS 1008, Heart as Vector: Thinking Across the Arts with Shahzia Sikander,,,,ARTS,"This course thinks across the arts with the remarkable artist Shahzia Sikander.

Sikander is internationally renowned for a pioneering, multi-media practice that takes classical Indo-Persian miniature painting as its point of departure, and inflects it with contemporary South Asian, American, Feminist, and Muslim perspectives. Sikander’s work stands in opposition to the idea of homogenous and authentic national cultures; instead, Sikander asks that we understand terms such as “tradition,” “culture” and “identity” as unstable, abstract, and constantly evolving. This course considers different aspects of Sikander’s practice, from her training in Indo-Persian painting to her work with poets, dancers, and composers. We’ll engage closely with South Asian paintings, and a range of texts, including works by Aruna D’Souza, Gayatri Gopinath, and Saidiya Hartman.",Bulletin

BIOL 2350, The Biology of Aging,,,,BIOL,"Aging is a fundamental biological process. It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of ""geroscience"" – the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases. Course material will be based on the primary research literature. Prerequisites are a background in cell biology, molecular biology and genetics - such as BIOL0470, BIOL0280, BIOL0200, and BIOL0800.SprBIOL2350S0120198Th2:00-5:00(11)(M. Tatar)",Bulletin

MATH 0100Single Variable Calculus, Part II",COST,"Human beings have long puzzled over how precisely to conceptualize and understand what and how it is that we are. Questions about the nature of the self have informed the speculations of philosophy, the soteriologies of religion, the trajectories of self-cultivation in contemplative traditions, and the therapeutics of psychology. Recently, cognitive science and phenomenology have developed new explanations for how multiple senses of self shape lived experience and give rise to various self-concepts. Students in this course will engage with dimensions of selfhood that we often take for granted by studying senses of self from multidisciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives.",CAB

The cool, flowing waters of the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates—veritable oases against the hostile deserts—influenced theories about sickness causation, as did religious knowledge of gods and demons. Libraries of priests and scholars contained recipe books, botanical treatises, magical incantations, rituals, and hymns, while home remedies included recipes against fevers, wounds, and headaches, as well as an awareness of which talismans protected infants and how to thwart being taken by demons that dance in the dark. Using texts in translation, archaeology, anthropological and bio-scientific publications, and even by recreating ancient medicines, this class takes a comparative look at the complex webs of social experience in ancient Thebes and Babylon, questioning our modern understanding of the human body and sickness.",CAB

Inspired by the groundbreaking work of Indigenous scholars, artists, and activists, we will explore the healing power of gender and sexual diversity. All throughout the course, we will also learn about the fight of Indigenous peoples to reclaim sovereignty over their own bodies. In this sense, we will approach Indigenous gender and sexuality as active tools for decolonization.

Since its most recent renaissance in the mid-2010s, the Sapphic has emerged as an elusive disruptor; an umbrella term that welcomes lesbians, wlw, nonbinary and trans femmes and mascs. This seminar explores how the Sapphic functions not just as an identity category but a methodology (a way of reading, writing, looking, listening) and an aesthetic in art, design, fashion, and food. What are the ways in which the Sapphic works with/against lesbian and queer political identities? How does contemporary use of the Sapphic diverge from its past iterations in literature, literary criticism, and visual culture? How might we understand temporality in Sapphic expression (slow-burn, yearning)?

In this lecture course, students will analyze how early modern artists, patrons, and scholars used the visual and cultural vocabulary of ancient Roman art to build monuments dedicated to civic virtue and imperial power, and how many of these artistic practices and cultural ideals continue to shape our society today. Examples of painting, sculpture, and architecture will all be considered. Students will also study the interdisciplinary methods employed by antiquarians and consider how contemporary art historical methodologies can be traced to early antiquarian practices. A",CAB

In this course, we will examine how American politics is shaped by struggles between social groups over the meanings and status of group identities. First, we will examine theoretical perspectives suggesting political behavior can be seen as symbolic action to affirm—and sometimes legally enforce—one’s own morality, social status, lifestyle practices, and vision of the proper social world. Then, we will apply this framework to understanding two areas of American politics: the politics of white racial resentment, and stalled political action to address climate change.

Through an examination of digital documentation created by ordinary citizens during major events in recent history—including the COVID-19 pandemic, racial justice protests, and the January 6 insurrection—we ask, what kinds of archives are we and our digital devices creating?

What can be a trace of the past? How have people followed these traces?

Yet the “grounds” of comparison are largely Euro-colonial turf, even when all the comparanda involved arrive from far outside the bounds of Western modernity. Led by readers of literature outside the circle of the modern West, this seminar asks: Can we compare from elsewhere? How can we attain comparative vantage points on culturally and temporally unalike texts without occupying the spaces of epistemic and political domination? Together we will interrogate grounds of comparison through explorations of transregional and transhistorical readings, including Third-Worldist manifestos, medieval Arabic philosophy, and multiscriptal poetics from early Japan. We consider the stakes and ethics of comparison and comparatism; strategies for decentering staid paradigms without turning our backs on theory or history; and potential affinities among mutually remote texts and their readers.",CAB

Drawing inspiration from various intellectual traditions, we will look at different scales of damage and repair. We will ask how these concepts have been used and abused in efforts to undo the harms which humans do to other humans, and to the world they inhabit and share. Advocating for reparations for slavery in the United States has often taken German reparations for Nazi crimes as a historical reference and precedent: our seminar will consider analogies and differences, as well as the limits of this model.

Likewise firms are supposed to police their supply chains, decarbonize their operations, raise their wages, and pay more taxes, all at once.

But in recent years, inequality and stagnant social mobility have been associated with increasing social and political distrust and unrest. In this junior seminar, we will examine the economic and political, and ideological factors that have contributed to this historical moment, learn about how Americans experience living in an unequal society, and consider the future of equality and social mobility in the United States.

Through an on-the-ground and ethnographic engagement with displaced communities worldwide, we interrogate analytical distinctions between legal and illegal categories of asylum seekers and migrants, internally displaced and refugees. Rather than treating refugeehood as an immanent crisis, we examine how the language of crisis shapes migration in the era of global capitalism.

IAPA 1804I, National Security Decision Making,,,,IAPA,"This undergraduate seminar examines theories of individual and group decision-making in the context of national security policy. It connects analytical perspectives from political science, social psychology, and organizational theory with a wide variety of historical cases featuring the United States, Soviet Union, China, India, Pakistan, Iraq, and Vietnam. What constitutes an “effective” decision-making process? What types of individuals, groups and institutions foster more effective processes? When are individuals or groups prone towards risky decisions? Do decision-making processes matter in “high-stakes” issues, such as war and peace? The last third of the course will examine these questions in the context of the 2018 US-China Trade War.",Bulletin

Yet, how violence is conceptualized, written, and represented in the social science record varies from discipline to discipline. In this course, we dig deep into the study of violence in its many forms (e.g., political, ethnic, bodily, and religious), focusing specifically on how it affects the everyday lives of people. Reading and watching content produced by academics and nonacademics in a broad range of social contexts such as India, Sri Lanka, Haiti, Rwanda, Kenya, Northern Ireland, and the United States, we will critically assess how the past and present violence inform our ways of thinking and writing about places and people that might be unfamiliar to us.",Bulletin

We read classic and more recent scholarship on colonial wars and violence, the ideology of the French “civilizing mission”, legal and economic discrimination and how colonialism transformed local ecologies. Colonial power was constantly debated, resisted, and subverted across metropole and colonies. We pay close attention to these voices and trace the emergence of political anti-colonialism in the aftermath of the First World War. We will examine how French colonialism was fought and eventually (partially) dismantled towards the middle of the 20th century. The course will end with an examination of current debates about the legacies of French colonialism in France and in formerly colonized countries.",Bulletin

What do writers hope to accomplish through the use of young protagonists? Who gets to be “young”? And how are our cultural beliefs about “youth” – and its comrades “time” and “mortality” – expressed through these works? To explore these questions, we’ll read works by Jamaica Kincaid, Sandra Cisneros, Neal Shusterman and Akwaeke Ezewki, among others.

Following Eva Horn to consider air as “a medium of life,” this graduate seminar explores the implications and possibilities in conception of atmospheric matters and conditions in relation to media history and theory. We propose the notion of “atmospheric media” as the center of our inquiry, approaching it both materially as atmospheric things (e.g., physicochemical compounds, movements, and reactions) and conceptually as atmospheric thinking (e.g., environmentality, immersion, and affect). Drawing from literatures in environmental science, media theory, ecocriticism, and decolonial thought, we hope to rethink air and media through their mutual entanglements.",CAB

MPA 2730, The Political Economy of Hard Policy Problems,,,,MPA,"This class tackles the “hard problems” of public policy. While governments are cajoled and enjoined to produce economic growth, do something about economic inequality and social mobility, and improve the life chances of millions through purposive action, actually delivering in these areas of policy is incredibly hard. These areas constitute ‘“hard problems” for policy for two main reasons. Economically, we don’t have much of a clue about how to do many of these things. Politically, there are powerful interests and entrenched ideas that like these areas of policy just as they are and work hard to keep them “hard problems.”",Bulletin

Throughout the pandemic, the reductive framing of public health’s greatest challenges —from addressing vaccine hesitancy, the rampant spread of pseudoscience and misinformation, or pervasive stigma and discrimination in communities of color—allowed our field to overlook the deep and undeniable historical roots of contemporary public health practice. This course will highlight the central role that historical determinants of public health continue to play in shaping health policy and response. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a prism, students will critically examine the successes and setbacks of earlier eras in public health history, providing them with the historical framing necessary to better understand and advocate for impactful public health interventions in the present and future.FallMPA2796S0119851W9:00-11:30(C.

PHUM 2021, Public Amnesias and Their Discontents:Theories and Practices of Remembering,,,,PHUM,"This course considers the consequences of forgetting as one of the challenges and provocations to the work of public humanities. By extending the histories of memory into discourses of “amnesia,” we will identify origins, effects, and the possibility of a return for material that has become forgotten or, more significant for us, made forgettable. This class is not about memory loss as an individual neurological condition, but as cultural and civic phenomena: specifically, how material objects in the public sphere become lost from view.",Bulletin
PHUM 2022, Public in Persons: Along Humanities’ Ethical Edges,,,,PHUM,"This course will offer a challenge and a potential to Public Humanities practices and theorizing: to place the irreducibility of individual human experiences as one of its most compelling and profound principles. This consideration differs from forms of “ethics” as they shaped traditional Western philosophy, where the focus was on the ways to lead “a good life” for a very specific, and small, part of the population. But recent ethical responses globally to racisms, genocides, and dispossessions now are frequency spoken in terms of responsibility, radical difference, vulnerability, and hospitality. This course will introduce students to how such ideas might inform “ethical praxis” in Public Humanities, offering case studies and guest presentations alongside writings addressing these four areas of interaction.",Bulletin

They are also keepers of knowledge. Museum collections and knowledge are constructed through distinctive power relations. There are of course different kinds of museums but the ethnographic museum has been one center piece of colonial collections. This course will examine how the collections of many museums were established. After this historical collection working through an genealogical method the course will then pay attention to the contemporary debates and practices of various attempts to decolonize various museums. In this regard we will pay attention to four museums: the Tropen Museum in Amsterdam; the British museum, Boston Museum of Fine Arts and to the National Art Gallery of South Africa.SprPHUM2023S0127526Th4:00-6:30(17)(B.

Although, the Russian literary angels are in many respects related to their Western counterparts, the apocalyptic character of Russian spiritual culture makes them in many respects unique. Examining these images, the course addresses the important questions concerning the human condition in general. Angels as one critic said, ""represent something that was ours and that we have the potential to become again""; their essence is otherness. Consequently, their literary representations explore the possibilities of human existence as well as its central paradigms like, love, rebirth, mortality, or 'fallenness.' The course will analyze the images of angels and fallen angels (devils) in the works of the nineteenth and the twentieth-century Russian prose, visual art, and film - from romanticism to 'postmodernism' - in the context of the world literature and culture. Authors to be studied: Byron, Lermontov, Balzac, Dostoevskii, Sologub, Bulgakov, Nabokov, Erofeev. We will also discuss films by Tarkovskii and Wenders, Russian icons, and paintings by Vrubel.

Given the country’s conflicted self-identification as neither fully European nor Asian, demarcations between the “self” and the “other” were more porous for Russian cultural practitioners than for their Western European counterparts, resulting in representations that were prone to hybridity, syncretism, and even self-Orientalization. Taking Edward Said’s definition of Orientalism as a point of departure, the course will examine the writings of Pushkin, Lermontov, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy; the paintings of Briullov, Aivazovskii, Vereshchagin, Polenov, Vrubel, Roerich, and Kuznetsov; and stage productions of The Tale of Tsar Saltan, Prisoner of the Caucasus, Scheherazade, and Les Orientales.

It seeks to understand how interdependence and social context shape the behavior of these entities. This course will present methods for analyzing network data and show how to implement them using the R programming language. We will also see how network concepts relate to social science theory about small groups, organizations, social capital, etc. The first part of the course emphasizes descriptive network analysis, covering basic statistics for describing networks, approaches to visualizing network data, measures of the centrality of individual units within a network, and methods for detecting network subgroups. The latter part considers inferential analyses that accommodate network data's complex structure of interdependencies. Models studied here include exponential random graph models (ERGMs), network autocorrelation models, and stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs).",CAB
