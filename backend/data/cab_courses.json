In the aftermath of the uprisings of 2020, abolition has become part of popular discourse in ways hardly imagined by some of its theorists and practitioners. The framework is most often aimed at carceral structures such as police, prisons, and surveillance, yet some interpretations of abolition take aim at the state, borders, and even the world. This seminar will explore the varied discourses of abolition and invite students to wrestle with the theoretical and practical difficulties the framework is confronted with, such as questions of law, politics, gender, and temporality. A key site of inquiry will be the methods of struggle proposed to get from the present to the anticipated abolitionist future. What \u201cpathways to abolition\u201d are prioritized, while others fall off the table?",

As such settler colonialism is heavily invested in both heteropatriarchy and heteronormativity as regulatory schemes oriented toward extraction and conquest. Through a series of theoretical readings, poetry, and literature, this Senior Seminar will explore the unruly \u201cqueerness\u201d of Indigeneity. During this course students will develop a keen understanding of the ways concepts such as relationality and (in)humanness are co-constitutive of a queer Indigenous analytic, while also learning how settler colonialism has impacted contemporary understandings of gender and sexuality. Students will explore the complexities of two-spirit identity through memoirs and reflective media, while also cultivating knowledge of two-spirit organizing efforts and theoretical interventions within the field of Native American and Indigenous Studies.",

Rather than seeing the State as a fixed, absolute entity that exists on a separate plane of existence, this course analyzes the state as an effect-producing abstraction that arises in contested circulations of meaningful signs. Viewing the state as a material abstraction (a complex sign) rather than as an absolute entity, we turn to theories of differentiation in circulation and movement. We attempt to answer the questions: What is movement? What moves? And what does movement create, break down, and change? Thinking about the implications of such questions, we will consider the extent to which differentiations in movement carve out units of governance, how the differences produced in those units might generate change, and how forms of difference might partially escape and alter such movement (or not).",

Through a series of detailed case studies we will survey the intentional destruction of images, monuments, and texts in the Near East over many millennia. In thinking about the religious, political, and aesthetic motivations that once incited ancient iconoclasm, we will also consider more recent and even contemporary incidents during which people have found the monuments around them to be deserving of annihilation.",

We can no longer take for granted what it means to be human, and our being-in-the-world poses itself as an abiding question mark. To be human and to live in time has become inextricable from a certain uncanniness. We will study key texts by three of the most insightful thinkers of this uncanniness: Freud, Heidegger, and one of their best readers, Derrida. Whether engaging with the dark vagaries of our sexuality, posing the question of \u201cBeing\u201d in relation to the horizon of our death, or elucidating the work of mourning: Freud, Heidegger, and Derrida help us to come to terms with the mysterious adventure of dwelling in the world as radically finite human beings.

From the early Desert Fathers and Mothers to influential figures like Ignatius of Loyola, Teresa of Avila, Saint John of the Cross, and modern voices such as Thomas Merton, these practices have offered powerful tools for inner transformation and social engagement. This course will examine the intersection of contemplation, mysticism, and action in the world from both historical and contemporary perspectives.

It focuses on functional programming, which provides a new experience for students who have already done some programming and a solid foundation for students who have never programmed at all. Students learn to design solutions to computational problems, solutions that are compact, elegant, and efficient. Over the course of the semester, the computational problems addressed grow in complexity, from simple (e.g. long addition) to moderate (e.g. implementation of one programming language in another) to sophisticated (e.g. an implementation of an AI game player for two-person games of complete information). We study clear and precise formulation of computational problems, use of recursion, and rudimentary analysis of algorithms. The emphasis is on problem solving and insight and crafting beautiful things rather than on coding.",

This class is aimed at graduate students conducting applied research who have begun conducting independent research. The class will first introduce and review important topics from game theory used in constructing models, but with an applied focus, taking into account common data restrictions and limitations. Emphasis will be placed on tools which can be used to complement existing research goals. Students will be expected to participate in class discussions, weekly assignments, and presentations/reviews of existing papers. Class time will be split between lectures and group discussions/presentations. The main deliverable for the course is to add a formal modeling section to an existing/ongoing independent research project.",

The cool, flowing waters of the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates\u2014veritable oases against the hostile deserts\u2014influenced theories about sickness causation, as did religious knowledge of gods and demons. Libraries of priests and scholars contained recipe books, botanical treatises, magical incantations, rituals, and hymns, while home remedies included recipes against fevers, wounds, and headaches, as well as an awareness of which talismans protected infants and how to thwart being taken by demons that dance in the dark. Using texts in translation, archaeology, anthropological and bio-scientific publications, and even by recreating ancient medicines, this class takes a comparative look at the complex webs of social experience in ancient Thebes and Babylon, questioning our modern understanding of the human body and sickness.",

We will interrogate this assumption about the stabilizing powers of religion in the cultural context of nineteenth through twenty-first century Britain and its empire. We will think through how this idea of religion appears in its interrelated domestic and colonial contexts, and how it continues to impact the public sphere across the world today.

Culturally, 1984 brought us Ghostbusters and The Terminator; Louise Erdrich\u2019s Love Medicine and Milan Kundera\u2019s The Unbearable Lightness of Being; Prince's Purple Rain; the creation of Tetris; and the rise of the infomercial.

Dysregulation of immune cells can cause disease progression; conversely, therapeutics capable of regulating immune cells can promote tissue regeneration or cancer cell killing. Immune engineering holds great potential for the development of therapeutics aimed at a broad range of diseases from autoimmunity to cancer and beyond. In this course, we will: (1) review key components of the immune system, (2) read and discuss primary research articles describing well-established and new immunotherapeutics, (3) discuss key concepts and laboratory techniques used in the design of immunotherapeutics, including strategies used to target drug delivery and design lipid nanoparticles, and (4) apply these concepts to design novel immune therapies.",

Moving beyond highly controlled scenarios presents many challenges. Most importantly, mobile robots will interact in complex environments with other robots and people. How can we ensure robots safely do what we want them to do? What are the ethical ramifications of multirobot systems? In this course, we study the past, present, and future of coordinated mobile robotics, including a discussion of ethics.

This seminar asks: Should the death of \"European hegemony\" lead to the death of theory? Should one get rid of the main concepts of European philosophy or should we rather \"de-Westernize\" our practice of critical thought? This course engages with current debates in the Critical Humanities and thus makes most of the major figures of continental philosophy accessible, from Hegel to Deleuze.

This seminar explores how the Sapphic functions not just as an identity category but a methodology (a way of reading, writing, looking, listening) and an aesthetic in art, design, fashion, and food. What are the ways in which the Sapphic works with/against lesbian and queer political identities? How does contemporary use of the Sapphic diverge from its past iterations in literature, literary criticism, and visual culture? How might we understand temporality in Sapphic expression (slow-burn, yearning)? Competency in Sapphic arts requires participation in seminar discussions, completion of 3 short essays, and a final essay/creative project.",

This seminar explores key currents in the anthropology of sex and gender, focusing on authors that draw on, elaborate, or contest psychoanalytic theory. How do sociocultural contexts shape sexual identities, desires, and practices? How are sexual normalization and subversion shaped by vectors of difference, like race, ethnicity, class, and religion? How do these debates relate to concepts such as violence, agency, capitalism, liberalism, sovereignty, and secularism? We\u2019ll consider historical and ethnographic materials across a range of contexts, including hormone science, sports scandals, ancestral rituals, factory work, beauty pageants, state-sanctioned violence, and psychotherapy. Case studies will be drawn from settler and indigenous North America, the Black diaspora, India, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, Greece, and Venezuela.",

Tracing histories of human ingenuity and value, we will examine the ways these things changed the people who saw them and were themselves changed in the process of being seen.

Discoveries of ancient masterpieces impacted the work of artists like Raphael and Michelangelo, and later Annibale Carracci, Peter Paul Rubens, and Gianlorenzo Bernini. In this lecture course, students will analyze how early modern artists, patrons, and scholars used the visual and cultural vocabulary of ancient Roman art to build monuments dedicated to civic virtue and imperial power, and how many of these artistic practices and cultural ideals continue to shape our society today. Examples of painting, sculpture, and architecture will all be considered. Students will also study the interdisciplinary methods employed by antiquarians and consider how contemporary art historical methodologies can be traced to early antiquarian practices. A",

Drawing from disciplines such as Science and Technology Studies, Latine Studies, and Literary and Translation Studies, we will examine topics such as science and latinidad, the changing geographies of knowledge, the historical production of lingua francas, and the relationship between science and literature in Spanish. With practice-based conversations with Latin American and Latine scientists and scholars every fortnight. Conducted in Spanish; student participation in English welcome.",

Although \u201cdisability\u201d is often (erroneously) exclusively attributed to later literary and historical moments, the \u201cnon-normative\u201d body was frequently centered in premodern negotiations of selfhood, embodiment, agency, and individual and collective identity. In addition to exploring and developing a critical vocabulary for discussions of medieval and early modern disability, and considering fully the charge of anachronism, students will be asked to engage with Medieval and Early Modern texts (and select Classical intertexts) that prioritize disease, diagnosis, impairment, medicine, and corporeal variance, etc., to better understand the determinative role that disability plays in the premodern Weltanschauung.",

Then, we will apply this framework to understanding two areas of American politics: the politics of white racial resentment, and stalled political action to address climate change.

We will examine how Black life has been shaped by, and has shaped, the outdoors and the environment more broadly \u2014 from the fields of the plantation to the vastness of outer space, from the breathless garrett to the open breeze, from the underwater afterlives of the Middle Passage to the speculative geographies of Black futures.",

We will critically read and examine ethnographic works that tackle \u201cwetness\u201d and \u201cfluidity\u201d as theoretical tools to understand temporality, circulation, and flow and challenge linear development projects from a feminist perspective.

Those traces have always been in flux, subject to changing cultural, environmental, and technological factors. While stone carvings, bones, ruins, and other durable objects have long encouraged reflections about the beings who created them, there are also those who have considered smells, flowers, dreams, and other seemingly ephemeral phenomena to be traces of distant pasts. What can be a trace of the past? How have people followed these traces? And how might the insights and oversights of these past ways of knowing the past inform our own efforts to identify or create traces for an uncertain future? This course explores some of the many ways in which individuals and communities have found and followed traces of earlier times.",

Led by readers of literature outside the circle of the modern West, this seminar asks: Can we compare from elsewhere? How can we attain comparative vantage points on culturally and temporally unalike texts without occupying the spaces of epistemic and political domination? Together we will interrogate grounds of comparison through explorations of transregional and transhistorical readings, including Third-Worldist manifestos, medieval Arabic philosophy, and multiscriptal poetics from early Japan. We consider the stakes and ethics of comparison and comparatism; strategies for decentering staid paradigms without turning our backs on theory or history; and potential affinities among mutually remote texts and their readers.",

We will ask how these concepts have been used and abused in efforts to undo the harms which humans do to other humans, and to the world they inhabit and share.

Our journey begins with an exploration of what we mean by \"technology\" and why certain technologies emerge, endure, or disappear over time. We will maintain a broad, global perspective while focusing primarily on the modern era, examining key themes such as the Industrial Revolution, economic growth, food systems, infrastructure, military technologies, artificial intelligence, and digital media. This multidisciplinary course invites you to ask big questions about the world and to think critically about the transformations that define our current technological landscape.",

The course also probes Israel's evolving stance toward global Jewry\u2014embracing, instrumentalizing, or distancing itself from diasporic Jewish identities\u2014while many Israeli citizens carry their own diasporic pasts. Through critical engagement with these dynamics, the course offers tools to think beyond binary framings of belonging and to understand how nationhood, memory, and identity are continuously negotiated in the Israeli context.",

Students are given the option to select the specific socio-political violence, reconciliation, and restoration experience in the Latin American region with which they wish to engage and produce their final collective project.

We will aim for a more nuanced view of Latin poetry and Roman culture between and around the better-studied poetic texts of the period.",

The second prong is to examine the cause and effect in the other direction: How do facts about human cognition in general shape language, and how can commonalities across languages be explained by non-linguistic facts about cognition? Of course these are both very broad questions; we will explore them with respect to specific domains such as pronoun systems, the expression of time, the encodings of differences between substances and objects, etc.",

Does it function like other media, such as photography and cinema, in expressing, communicating, and documenting life and experience? Following Eva Horn to consider air as \u201ca medium of life,\u201d this graduate seminar explores the implications and possibilities in conception of atmospheric matters and conditions in relation to media history and theory. We propose the notion of \u201catmospheric media\u201d as the center of our inquiry, approaching it both materially as atmospheric things (e.g., physicochemical compounds, movements, and reactions) and conceptually as atmospheric thinking (e.g., environmentality, immersion, and affect). Drawing from literatures in environmental science, media theory, ecocriticism, and decolonial thought, we hope to rethink air and media through their mutual entanglements.",

The examination of one seminal album a week will serve as a course guide. We will build deep listening skills, listen in various settings, and use different playback devices (vinyl to digital) to critically reflect on and challenge our own habits of music consumption. Furthermore, critical readings and writing assignments accompany each album to prompt further exploration of topics surrounding genre, culture, identity, race, and the interplay between tradition and postmodernism.

Additional topics include philosophical questions raised by large language models, the Turing Test, embodied cognition, animal minds, and consciousness. Students will engage with foundational texts and current research while developing their own philosophical analyses. No prerequisites.",

Students will explore the philosophical underpinnings of these qualitative data analysis approaches and consider their application in the context of critical theories and methodologies, including intersectionality. Students will also learn practical skills involved in qualitative data analysis, including codebook development, coding, developing themes, categories, and conceptual models, writing memos, and disseminating findings to diverse audiences. The course centers issues of power, ethics, positionality, and reflexivity in the context of qualitative research with minoritized populations and discusses community- and arts-based participatory research approaches. The course also addresses methods for combining qualitative and quantitative research findings in the context of a mixed-methods research approach. Students will have the option to analyze their own or others' qualitative data.",

Bringing together literary and cinematic works, we will explore different concepts and areas of study within sound culture (soundscape, listening, noise, silence, voice, etc). Key questions include: How does sound function as a narrative device, a mode of resistance, or a bearer of collective memory? How do soundscapes reflect or challenge colonial and postcolonial realities? How do Lusophone artists use sound to bridge the oral and the written, the seen and the heard?

This course is premised on the conviction that democracy requires an active citizenry but that the activity of people in communities does not have to be entirely limited or circumscribed by existing institutional arrangements and distributions of power but may also require organized efforts to alter those",

Yet, there are significant disagreements over what students should learn and what end(s) this learning should serve. This course will examine perennial debates at the intersection of education and citizenship in modern and contemporary political thought. What knowledge, capacities, and dispositions are necessary for citizenship in liberal democracies? How should they be taught and by whom? What is the proper distribution of educational authority between parents, children, and the state? Should civic education promote \u201cpatriotism?\u201d What are the effects of socio-economic inequality on civic education and citizenship? How do the philosophical, economic, and political views of various thinkers influence their approaches to education for citizenship?",

This course aims to fill that gap by focusing on Christian contemplation and mysticism. Contemplative practices have long played a vital role in spiritual development, guiding individuals toward a deeper connection with the Divine. From the early Desert Fathers and Mothers to influential figures like Ignatius of Loyola, Teresa of Avila, Saint John of the Cross, and modern voices such as Thomas Merton, these practices have offered powerful tools for inner transformation and social engagement. This course will examine the intersection of contemplation, mysticism, and action in the world from both historical and contemporary perspectives. It will also introduce the emerging field of neurospirituality, exploring how contemplative and mystical experiences can affect the brain and contribute to psychological, emotional, and spiritual well-being.",

We will also interrogate broader methodological questions, including comparative projects between \u201cRoman\u201d and \u201cPersian\u201d contexts, models of scholarly representation, and the limits of agonistic/assimilative frameworks.

This seminar explores the relation between people, place, identity, and belonging, with a strong emphasis on racial, Indigenous, feminist, queer, and environmental justice. The seminar begins by interrogating the concept of home broadly. What constitutes notions of home and belonging? We then move to different frameworks through which we explore the concept of home: for example, nationhood, colonialism, and globalization; Earth as home and more-than-human dwelling; Indigenous dispossession and homemaking; feminist and queer ways of belonging; Black homes as sites of resistance, tenderness, and beauty; belonging and precarity among the unhoused and the incarcerated.

Although, the Russian literary angels are in many respects related to their Western counterparts, the apocalyptic character of Russian spiritual culture makes them in many respects unique. Examining these images, the course addresses the important questions concerning the human condition in general. Angels as one critic said, \"represent something that was ours and that we have the potential to become again\"; their essence is otherness. Consequently, their literary representations explore the possibilities of human existence as well as its central paradigms like, love, rebirth, mortality, or 'fallenness.' The course will analyze the images of angels and fallen angels (devils) in the works of the nineteenth and the twentieth-century Russian prose, visual art, and film - from romanticism to 'postmodernism' - in the context of the world literature and culture. Authors to be studied: Byron, Lermontov, Balzac, Dostoevskii, Sologub, Bulgakov, Nabokov, Erofeev. We will also discuss films by Tarkovskii and Wenders, Russian icons, and paintings by Vrubel. In English. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students.",

First, it sets up a historical context for the region, focusing on how critical events such as the partition and Indian independence from British rule invited a line of scholarly preoccupations with colonialism, post-colonialism and nationhood. At the same time, it dwells on how historiography itself might become a political object in the light of social upheaval. Second, it examines the particularities of these upheavals: religious and ethnic majoritarianism, gendered violence, class and caste-based hierarchies, as well as the political orders \u2013sovereignty, democracy, secularity, that they resist and abide by in everyday life. Third, the course compares ritual, ethical and linguistic practices, born from a characteristically South Asian confluence.",

Looking at the transformations around them \u2013 the rise of capitalism, the modern nation-state, rational bureaucracy, the spread of colonialism, the decline of religion, struggles for emancipation and much more \u2013 they developed arguments that allow us to better understand ourselves, our actions, and the contemporary political, economic and social transformations around us. We explore the defining contributions of these theorists and link them to current debates and theories on systemic racism, gender/sex struggles, global inequalities, social movements and democracy.",

The latter part considers inferential analyses that accommodate network data's complex structure of interdependencies.

While audio is not a great medium for communicating numbers and statistics, it excels at the complexities of character and feeling. That\u2019s where we will focus our storytelling energies. In the spirit of inquiry, we will produce narratives that offer more questions than answers. Students will learn the fundamentals of field recording, interviewing, story structure, writing for the ear, audio editing, sound design, and scoring.",

Through improvisatory research in sensing, translation, non-hierarchy, structure, tone, and task, students will explore where movement is sourced and how to pattern with the resulting materials in time and space. The course will focus primarily on creation in solo and duet frameworks, but studio time will also be spent composing together in ensemble. Building skill in observation, critical analysis, self-evaluation, and reflection on creative process will be central to this work, and course participants will be supported in creating choreographic work for inclusion in the Fall Festival of Dance.
